In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary Applications and Tools that you will need to code in C# and C++ with SplashKit.  
We will be using the **Terminal** app, with the **zsh** shell. You can also use the **bash** shell if you prefer.

:::note[Already have SplashKit installed?]
If you have previously installed SplashKit (before 2024):

- Update SplashKit using your Terminal, with the command: `skm update`
- Then you can skip to Step [3. Install SplashKit Globally](#3-install-splashkit-globally)

:::

Now, let's get started!

To get SplashKit and other coding tools installed on macOS, follow the five steps or the optional steps tab for a custom install:

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Xcode Command Line Tools"
    description="Step 1"
    href="/installation/macos/step-1/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install SplashKit SDK"
    description="Step 2"
    href="/installation/macos/step-2/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install SplashKit Globally"
    description="Step 3"
    href="/installation/macos/step-3/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Visual Studio Code"
    description="Step 4"
    href="/installation/macos/step-4/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Language Specific Tools"
    description="Step 5"
    href="/installation/macos/step-5/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Optional Setup Steps"
    description="Step 6"
    href="/installation/macos/step-6/"
  />
</CardGrid>

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to
start building SplashKit applications in the language of your choice.
