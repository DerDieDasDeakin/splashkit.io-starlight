## 1. Install XCode Command Line Tools

**Xcode Command Line Tools** is a package of tools provided by Apple for developers to enable command-line development and building of software on macOS, using your **Terminal** app. *It includes tools you will need for installing SplashKit and coding in the next chapters.*

To install these tools, run the command below in your *Terminal* app:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
