In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary Applications and Tools that you will need to code in C# and C++ with SplashKit.  
We will be using the **Terminal** app, with the **zsh** shell. You can also use the **bash** shell if you prefer.

:::note[Already have SplashKit installed?]
If you have previously installed SplashKit (before 2024):

- Update SplashKit using your Terminal, with the command: `skm update`
- Then you can skip to Step [3. Install SplashKit Globally](#3-install-splashkit-globally)

:::

Now, let's get started!

To get SplashKit and other coding tools installed on macOS, follow the steps outlined below:

## 1. Install XCode Command Line Tools

**Xcode Command Line Tools** is a package of tools provided by Apple for developers to enable command-line development and building of software on macOS, using your **Terminal** app. *It includes tools you will need for installing SplashKit and coding in the next chapters.*

To install these tools, run the command below in your *Terminal* app:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
