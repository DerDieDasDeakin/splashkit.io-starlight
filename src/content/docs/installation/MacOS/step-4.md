Visual Studio Code, also commonly known as *VS Code* or just *Code*, is a powerful and versatile code editor that enables efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration for your SplashKit projects!

:::note[VS Code has it all!]
Once you have your code project set up, Visual Studio Code will be the main program you will use to write, build, run and debug your code.
:::

First you will need to download the zip file from: [code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

To install: double-click the downloaded zip file, then click and drag the **Visual Studio Code** Application file into the ***Applications*** folder.

### Add 'code' command to PATH

You can install the `code` command to allow you to open any file or folder in a new Visual Studio Code window, right from your Terminal!

Follow the steps in the [**Launching from the command line**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) section of the *Visual Studio Code on macOS* article to install this command.

:::tip[Troubleshooting tip:]
If you are having issues with the `code` command not working after following the steps above, go to the ['zsh: command not found: code'](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/0-installation/3-0-troubleshooting-install/#zsh-command-not-found-code) section in the Installation Troubleshooting page for to use an alternative installation process.
