Some coding languages require specific tools/frameworks to be installed to be able to build and run your code files.  
As you will be coding in C# and C++ in this book, let's look at the tools needed for these languages:

### C# Tools

For coding in C#, you will need to install the `.NET` SDK which will allow you to use the *dotnet* terminal command to create, build, and run your C# project code.

Download the latest version of the .NET SDK for macOS from the official .NET website: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Run the downloaded installer and follow on-screen instructions.

### C/C++ Tools

For coding in C++, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed to build your C++ code into a file you can use to run your program. Commonly used C++ compilers are `g++` and `clang++`.

:::note
If you installed Xcode Command Line Tools successfully in Step 1, then you will already have the necessary compilers installed and ready for coding in C++!
