Building programs really requires that you have access to a computer that you can play around with. To maximise your experience, we have designed things to work with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) single board computer.

![Image of the full Raspberry Pi multi-tool](./src/assets/images/Pi-Computer/CompeteSetup.jpg)

Using the _Raspberry Pi_ Multi-tool will give you several advantages:

- You can play around with Unix without risking your day-to-day computer (which you can switch to Linux once you are more confident)
- The Raspberry Pi include pins for **General Purpose Input / Output** (**GPIO**) though a [40-pin header](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#gpio-and-the-40-pin-header) on the board:

We can use this to interact with electronics and see how we can control things in the real world using code.

- Playing with a Raspberry Pi is just more fun 😁.

:::note[Where do you get one of these multi-tools?]
You don't. You _build it yourself_.

The next couple of pages will go over how to build and configure the multi-tool. You can then use it for the activities in the next chapters.
:::

We will first look at the hardware you need, and where you can get it, and then we can look at the software you need and how you can install that using the [Terminal](/book/part-0-getting-started/2-computer-use/1-concepts/01-terminal) on your Pi.

:::caution[Alternatives to the multi-tool]
Not sure if you want the hardware, but still want to set something like this up? There are some alternatives.

Rather than getting a new physical machine, you can download virtual machine software and follow the software setup to get it working in there.

Let's get going!
