To interact with the Raspberry Pi's Operating System, we will need to connect the **Screen**, **Keyboard**, and **Mouse** to the Pi in a _somewhat specific_ way. These steps below will guide you through the correct set up.

### Attach the Display Screen with VESA mount

Take the screen out of its box, and grab the nylon screws/spaces from the VESA mount that we put aside earlier:

:::danger[Important!]
Make sure the SD card is inserted before connecting the screen, or you will likely need to remove the screen to insert it.
:::

To attach the Raspberry Pi to the display screen:

- Face the top of the screen towards yourself
- Place two of the spacers on the VESA mount holes on the screen closets to the top.
- Place the Pi on top of the spacers.
- Place the other spaces on the nylon screws
- Secure the Pi to the screen using the two nylon screws and four spacers. You can use your fingers to tighten the screws.

Here are some images to help you follow along:

Next, locate the **Micro HDMI to HDMI** and **20 cm USB-C to USB-A** cables (as shown below):

For the **20 cm USB-C to USB-A** cable:

- Connect the USB-C end to the Screen's "Display & Touch" port.
- Connect the USB-A end to one of the USB-A ports on the end of the Pi.

For the **Micro HDMI to HDMI** cable:

- Connect the Micro HDMI to the Pi's **first** HDMI port (closest to the power USB-C port).
- Connect the full-size HDMI to the Screen's "HDMI" port.

:::tip[Recommendations]

- Make sure the Micro HDMI is connected to the first port as shown in the images above. Using the second HDMI port may cause sound issues.
- Putting a loop in the cable will help with cable management.

The suggested screen comes with a handy little stand so that you can set it up easily on a table or desk.

Remove the stand from it's packaging and bend into the shape shown in the image below:

Place the display screen on the stand.

_Note: It can be a challenging to get the screen to sit correctly, so you may need to fiddle with the cables:_

### Connect the Keyboard and Mouse

To allow you to use the Raspberry Pi and screen in the same way you would use a regular computer/laptop, we need to connect the keyboard and mouse.

Locate your **Raspberry Pi Official Keyboard** and **Raspberry Pi Official Mouse**:

Using the cable in the keyboard box, connect the **micro USB** end to the micro USB port on the keyboard, and the **USB-A** end to one of the black USB-A ports (USB 2.0) on the Pi.
