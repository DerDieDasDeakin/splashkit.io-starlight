There are multiple configurations you can use to power the multi-tool.

### Using Mains Power

The easiest way to power the multi-tool is to use the power supply that came with the Pi.

**To use mains power:**

- Connect the USB-C end to the Pi's USB-C power port.
- Plug the other end into a power outlet.

Fold the screen down to plug in the power supply.

### Using Battery Power

If you are on the go or want to use the multi-tool in a location without power, you can use a battery/power bank.

**To use battery power:**

- Locate the longer USB-C to USB-A cable.
- Connect the USB-A end to the power bank.
- Connect the USB-C end to the Pi.
- The power bank will turn on automatically.

:::note
For intense workloads you may need to connect the display directly to the battery bank rather than via the Pi.

This can be done either with the supplied USB-C to USB-C cable or using the 20Cm USB-C to USB-A cable. _(Note that will disable the touch functionality of the screen.)_

Here is the setup using the **USB-C to USB-C cable**:
