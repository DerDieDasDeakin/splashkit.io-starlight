To install MSYS2, double-click the downloaded executable file, and follow the on-screen instructions.  
*It is recommended to use the default install path, but you can customise the other installation options as needed.*

:::note[Which Terminal?]
MSYS2 comes with a variety of terminal environments. The **MINGW64** terminal environment is recommended for 64-bit computers (MINGW32 for 32-bit) as it has been found to support the C# and C++ terminal commands you will use.

Therefore, you should use the **MINGW64** (MSYS2 MINGW64) terminal, which you can find by searching "mingw64" in the Windows Start menu and selecting the **MSYS2 MINGW64** App.

:::tip[Pin it!]
To make it easier to open each time, you can pin your terminal to the Taskbar.

- Open MINGW64 terminal.
- Right-click on the MSYS2 App icon in the taskbar (shown in the orange box in the image below).
- Select "Pin to taskbar" (shown in the pink box):
