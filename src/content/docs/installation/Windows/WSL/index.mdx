In this guide, we will walk through the steps to install the necessary Applications and Tools on **WSL** (**W**indows **S**ubsystem for **L**inux) *with Ubuntu*. This will enable you to code in C# and C++ with SplashKit.

Now, let's get started!

To set up WSL and install SplashKit and other coding tools on Windows, follow the six steps outlined below:

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
<LinkCard
	title="Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)"
	description="Step 1"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-1/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install Command Line Tools"
	description="Step 2"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-2/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install SplashKit SDK"
	description="Step 3"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-3/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install SplashKit Globally"
	description="Step 4"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-4/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install Visual Studio Code"
	description="Step 5"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-5/"
/>
<LinkCard
	title="Install Language Specific Tools"
	description="Step 6"
	href="/installation/windows/wsl/step-6/"
/>
</CardGrid >


Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to
start building SplashKit applications in the language of your choice.
